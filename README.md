**Graduate Research Assistant @ University of Maryland Baltimore County (_May 2022 - Present_)**
- Working on building explainable AI models to interpret neural network decisions and develop generalized AI frameworks.
- Working on profiling energy consumption and real-time latency of deep neural networks on FPGAs and mobile edge GPUs for keyword spotting, activity monitoring, image segmentation, and classification with hardware-aware network exploration.
- Working on metric learning-based semi-supervised deep neural network training to build improved feature spaces of lightweight and low-power models.
- Working on building perception methodologies for navigation and situational awareness of autonomous robots.

**Intern - Machine Learning @ Infineon Technologies (_June 2022 - December 2023_)**
- Worked as an intern at Infineon Technologies Machine learning team with a concentration on building explainable AI models for audio, images, and time-series data.
- Developed autoencoder-based reconstruction pipelines for channel estimation with WLAN data and applied deep unrolling methods to mimic iterative signal processing approaches.
- Built end-to-end streaming inference pipeline using Python sockets for human sensing with WIFI data.
- Developed the GradCAM explanation pipeline for the InfExplain demonstration.
